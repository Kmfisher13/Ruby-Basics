Locate the documentation for break, and determine what value break sets the
return value to for the while loop.

The documentation for break is listed in the Core API, under control expressions,
near the bottom of the page as "break Statement". It is also listed on the Object
class page.

Break ends the while loop early, and returns nil. If break is supplied an
argument, break will return a value based on that argument.
